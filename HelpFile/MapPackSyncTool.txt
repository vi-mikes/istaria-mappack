Welcome to MapPack Sync Tool by Cegaiel.

MapPack 5.0 (newly implemented) uses \resources_override\mappack\resources folder.
MapPack 4.0 (deprecated) uses resources_override\resources folder, which we've incorrectly used for many years.
This new path is what differentiates 4.0 vs 5.0.

The reason we are using \resources_override\mappack\resources now is so that it is more mod friendly.
It will help to avoid confusion when you add mod files that previously shared folders that MapPack 4.0 used.

Now we can be sure that any files that exist in the \resources_override\mappack files should only contain mappack files.
Hence this folder can be safely deleted, in future, without potentially removing mod files that you might've added.

After Add/Sync'ing: You can continue using \resources_override\resources folder for any existing mods and keep it separate from MapPack files which was previously intertwined. Syncing will remove any old mappack 4.0 folders/files (only if listed in manifest) and add new mappack 5.0 folders/files. There should be no issues, after syncing MapPack, for it to continue/start working.

Explanation of buttons:

Browse button:
- Select the folder your Istaria game exists. The selected folder MUST contain istaria.exe (to verify you're in the correct path).
- You can also manually type the path, in the text box (to the left of Browse button), too.
- Once you click Add/Sync or Remove buttons then this path is remembered, each subsequent time the program is started, in future.

Add/Sync button:
- Install MapPack 5.0 if it does not exist (see next line).
- Sync MapPack 5.0 files which includes adding or removing files that differs from the manifest.
- Deletes any EMPTY directories in \resoures_override\mappack folder, after the sync.
- This will also verify and set 'string mapPath = "resources_override/mappack/resources/interface/maps"' which is the new 5.0 path.

Cancel Action button:
- Self-explanatory. This will stop all processes during Add/Sync or Remove buttons. Button is only enabled while processes are running.

Remove button:
- Uninstall MapPack. This will remove BOTH MapPack 5.0 as well any older versions such as 4.0 listed in manifest.
- This will also verify and set 'string mapPath = "resources/interface/maps"' which is the original/vanilla path.


If you get any errors about deletions then run this file as Administrator (right click file, Run as Admin).
